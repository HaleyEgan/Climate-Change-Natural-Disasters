Climate Change is a major crisis facing humanity. Communities appear to be facing unprecedented challenges such as drought, wildfires, flooding, extreme temperatures, and more. Scientists have communicated that as Climate Change continues, these natural disasters will increase in frequency and severity. 

In order to gain more insight into natural disasters and their trends over time, we examined two datasets, one on natural disasters and another on the economic impacts of these natural disasters. Between 1900 and 2018, 13,212 natural disasters were recorded, with a total economic impact of $5,615,399,927,000 (over 5.5 trillion USD). 

We wanted to answer the following questions:
- Are natural disasters increasing over time?
- Are natural disasters increasing in severity over time?
- Are natural disasters and their severity linked to Climate Change?

# Instructions for Running Code

follow the link to our jupyter notebook here: (link)[https://github.com/HaleyEgan/Climate-Change-Natural-Disasters/blob/main/Report/Climate_Change_and_Economic_Impact.ipynb]
You'll find a button that says "Run In Colab". That notebook should open in your drive as a new colab notebook. The script will clone and copy our repository and leverage the code written in the <u>Source</u> directory, including our unittests. The code is all OOP, so there need only be a few lines of code written to execute on complex operations.
