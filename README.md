Climate Change is a major crisis facing humanity. Communities appear to be facing unprecedented challenges such as drought, wildfires, flooding, extreme temperatures, and more. Scientists have communicated that as Climate Change continues, these natural disasters will increase in frequency and severity. 

In order to gain more insight into natural disasters and their trends over time, we examined two datasets, one on natural disasters and another on the economic impacts of these natural disasters. Between 1900 and 2018, 13,212 natural disasters were recorded, with a total economic impact of $5,615,399,927,000 (over 5.5 trillion USD). 

We wanted to answer the following questions:
- Are natural disasters increasing over time?
- Are natural disasters increasing in severity over time?
- Are natural disasters and their severity linked to Climate Change?

# Explanation of Variables
In this section, we provide definitions and context for the variables and numbers given in our data set. 

## Disaster entry criteria
The primary criteria for a disaster to be included in the data set is one of more of the following:
- At least 10 deaths 
- At least 100 people affected (including injured or homeless)
- The declaration of a state of emergency or an appeal for international assistance.
- In the event that exact numbers were missing, secondary criteria were also considered, e.g. if a disaster was recognized as the worst in that category for the given country.

## Economic Damage
The figures for total economic damage are derived from the following:

- The total estimated damages (i.e. economic losses from damaged property, infrastructure, environmental, etc.) 
- Reconstruction costs (the cost of replacing lost assets, which differs from the previous in that it involves the present cost of goods, and any costs associated with prevention or mitigation measures regarding future disasters) 
- Insured losses (economic damages covered by insurance companies). 
 
All amounts are given in thousands of U.S. dollars, as valued in 2019.    

## Data Sources
Our data is a subset from Kaggle of a more comprehensive disaster dataset maintained by EM-DAT, the International Disaster Database. It is drawn primarily from UN agencies, national governments and the International Red Cross / Crescent.  The data is updated on a daily basis but updates are made available publicly every three months.
